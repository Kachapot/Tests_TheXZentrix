1. Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
    Answer: 
        SQL databases are structured and use tables to store data.
            Advantages:
                - Has a clear structure.
                - Has strong rules to keep data accurate and consistent.
                - Good for complex queries and reports.

            Disadvantages:
                - It is not suitable for handling a lot of changing or unpredictable data.
                - It is not flexible to scale the system.
        
        NoSQL databases are flexible and can store unstructured data in various formats.
            Advantages:
                - Fast-moving projects When data changes a lot.
                - Handling huge amounts of data across many servers.
                - Good for storing things like user profiles, chat messages, or real-time analytics.
            
            Disadvantages:
                - It enforces strict rules to ensure perfect data consistency.
                - Limited query capability.


2. Have you ever worked with microservices architectures? If so, can you explain the benefits and drawbacks of this approach?
    Answer:
        Benefits of Microservices:
            - Scalable independently
            - Flexible technology choices
            - Better fault isolation
            - Faster development and deployment
            - Easier to maintain and update
            - Fits well with Agile and DevOps

        Drawbacks of Microservices:
            - More complex to manage
            - Challenges with distributed communication and data consistency
            - Harder testing and deployment
            - Potential performance overhead due to network calls
            - Complex data management across services


3. Describe your experience with caching in backend applications. When would you use caching, and what tools or frameworks do you prefer?
    Answer:
        I implement caching to prevent redundant data loading, particularly for data that changes infrequently.
